        <h4> Arrays </h4>
          <p>
            An array is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of objects. To simplify what that means for example lets take a list of food we like, it can be fish, salad, chicken or anything so an array is just a container to hold all our favorite food.
          </p>
          <xmp>
            favorite_food = [‘fish’,’salad,’chicken’]
          </xmp>
          <p>
            so what does integer-indexed means? to help us find a particular object in an array, each slot is given an index number or keys starting from 0 like ( <code>[0]</code> = fish, <code>[1]</code> = salad etc). The first element is always <code>[0]</code> and <code>[1]</code> is always the second element, etc. we can use the keys in order to access the elements in array:
          </p>
          <xmp>
           favorite_food [0] = ‘fish’
           favorite_food [1] = ‘salad’
           favorite_food [2] = ‘chicken’
          </xmp>
          <p>
            Ruby lets us to apply different methods on an array. for example we can use <code>.count</code> method in order to know how many elements we have in an array in this case
          </p>
          <xmp>
          favorite_food.count = 3
          </xmp>
          <h4> Hashes </h4>
          <p>
           Hashes are an unordered, object-indexed collection of objects (or key-value pairs)
           It is a collection of “key-value pairs. A key-value pair is a combination of the name of a container ( i.e the key ) and the contents of the container ( i.e the value).
          </p>
          <p>
           for example if I want to explain about the movies that i like along with the actors I will write it like
          </p>
          <xmp>
            favorite_movies = { “shane” => “a walk to remember”,“Liam” => “taken”}
          </xmp>
          <p>
            when creating a hash, we simple use <code>{ }</code>. Hashes requires use of <code> => </code>  called rocket to assign the value on the right side of the rocket to the key on the left side.To access values within the hash, you have to specify the name of the hash, along with the key for the value you are trying to access.
          </p>
          <xmp>
            favorite_movies ["shane"] = a walk to remember
          </xmp>
          <p>
          From the above example, if we want only to get the values of the keys we simply can use <code>favorite_movies.keys</code> returns all the keys and same goes for the values too.
         </p>
         <p>
          Both arrays and hashes are good on their own way and when to use which depends on what we actually is looking. for example if I create an array which explains my name, last name, gender, eye color…lets say
         </p>
         <xmp>
            person = [ “Beth”, “Tad”, “Female”, “Blue”]
         </xmp>
        <p>
          Now we don’t know if blue is standing for my eye color or the cloth am wearing so in this case is better to create hashes
       </p>
       <xmp>
        person = {‘first_name’ => ‘Beth’, ‘last_name’ => ‘Tad’,
                  ‘gender’  => ‘Female’, ‘eye-color’ => ‘Blue’}
       </xmp>
       <p>
        They both are  accessible using a key. With arrays, the key is an integer, whereas hashes support any object as a key. Both arrays and hashes grow as needed to hold new elements. It's more efficient to access array elements, but hashes provide more flexibility. Any particular array or hash can hold objects of differing types; you can have an array or hash containing an integer, a string, and a floating point number.
