How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It's easier than doing it alone since we were sharing ideas and discussing on how it should look"

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

yes it was helpful. It helps to visualize the website and work on the contents as we wanted to. makes the thinking process easy

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

we both did wireframe for previous excercise so we decided to look in to what we did previously and argued on what to add and leave.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I have learned about <header> and <footer> elements which i didn't used before. it was interesting to know.
