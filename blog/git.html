      Version control is a way of tracking changes made on a file, it remembers all the changes made and when the changes are made. There are many benefits for using version control. To mention some, version control can be a way of storing changes made in a file. we are able to navigate through the versions of the project we are making and that gives us security knowing we can go back and forth through the versions. Version control can also let us to work collaboratively in one file, anybody on the team can work freely on any file at any time. we can write a description of what we changed briefly so the other user able to understand simply what we changed.

         Git is a fast and modern implementation of version control. Git is the system that saves the contents of the file in your project. Git allows us to work on project from our computer locally and every time we commit using a git command git commit, we are saving the changes that we made. I believe, git is a drive for version control to track the changes.
