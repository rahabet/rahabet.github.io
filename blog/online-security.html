      online security also known as internet security is a very vast topic with a lot to cover. even if the online world is an amazing place to explore and easily accessible to anyone, there are some risks associated with it. Its good to know who your are dealing with or what youâ€™re getting into. cyber criminals will try to take advantage of unwary visitors. Internet security encompasses browser security, the security of data entered through a Web form, and overall authentication and protection of data sent via Internet Protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer networks hold valuable and often protected, private information,              not least data on identities; credit cards; financial data; technical, trade, and government secrets; mailing lists; medical records; and the list could be continued. These data are vulnerable on the computer and in transit. The Internet, as a connector between computer systems, is also a highway of access to valuable data stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vulnerabilities are loss of data through malicious erasure, the acquisition of       proprietary information, the manipulation of the data such as illegal withdrawals and transfers of funds, the capture and criminal use of credit cards or identities, and any and all unauthorized uses to which information may be put. Internet security breaches can also potentially have direct physical consequences if the wrong people hijack systems that control transportation or power systems. Computers have become so pervasive, and their networking so universal, that Internet security and security in general are closely linked objectives of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important actions that one can have in mind is  1) disciplined use of computer systems including careful password and e-mail control, 2) installation and upgrading of firewalls between internal networks and the Internet, 3) alertness to news stories about new viruses and breaches and 4) prompt reporting of breaches to the authorities as soon as they are detected.
