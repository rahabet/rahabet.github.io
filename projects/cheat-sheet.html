    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SQL </td>
    <td>It is how we write to and retrieve data from relational database management system</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>RDBMS</td>
    <td>It is a way that data is presented to the end  user in the form of tables, columns and rows.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Three value logic </td>
    <td>Unlike other programming languages,SQL has a three value logic which are True/False and unknown(NULL)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Primary Key</td>
    <td>It is a column or set of columns that are guaranteed to be unique in a given row.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Foreign Key </td>
    <td> It is a referential constraint between two tables that informs data integrity.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Result Set</td>
    <td>The results returned from a SELECT statement.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Predicate</td>
    <td>An expression that evaluates to True, False or Unknown. We use predicates on WHERE, HAVING and JOINS.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SELECT *
      <br>FROM table_name
    </td>
    <td>This means that return all columns in the table_name at runtime. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>SELECT *
      <br>FROM table_name
      <br>WHERE column_name(=, > )num/string
    </td>
    <td>the where clause must decide if something is true or false. A row with a non-null value is either true or false for each predicate. It determines which rows to include in the result set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>IN and NOT IN </td>
    <td>allows you to build lists (Values) : Lets say if asked to find a customer from a Customers table with CustomerId 1,3,4,5 we write:
      <br>SELECT *
      <br>FROM Customers
      <br>WHERE CustomerId IN (1,3,4,5)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BETWEEN </td>
    <td>allows you to test ranges:
      <br>SELECT *
      <br>FROM Customers
      <br>WHERE CustomerId BETWEEN 10 AND 20
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LIKE</td>
    <td>allows for pattern matching:lets say we want to get all names where the first letter starts by c.we write
      <br>SELECT *
      <br>FROM Customers
      <br>WHERE name LIKE “c%”
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DISTINCT</td>
    <td>SQL does allow duplicates in the result set but the use of DISTINCT eliminate duplicate “rows” from result set but only if the whole row is a duplicate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TOP</td>
    <td> returns the top “n” rows and its result can be affected by the ORDER BY. TOP get processed after the query is ordered by something we want.
      <br>SELECT TOP(3)
    </td>
  </tr>
