##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

  I learned about border stylings (solid, dashed…). I also learned how padding and margins work to increase the readability of my website and to make it neat. It wasn’t simple for me to figure out what value to give it. but its a learning process that I hope I will master soon.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?

  I learned that its a little bit challenging to use relative and absolute paths and messed me up so I decided to have a minimum use of it.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

  Placing and styling the skeleton part was not difficult. the header at the top, the side bar at the right and so on but making them collaborate (positon) and work on the margins, paddings and stuff was a little consuming for me which is also fun to mess it up and comeback to change something. I am still trying to figure out how to open a link in a new tab/window instead of my page disappears when I open link from the content.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

  I noticed css makes the webpage looks pretty. As am new for html and css, last week doing html was fun and also not pretty since I wasn’t applying any styles but having that now to my page, I would say it looks much more neat. so I believe css is very crucial. Also being able to work on css stuff alone in a separate sheet is awesome. it makes it really easy to see what kind of changes am making and where. it is readable and perfect I would say for now. and may be will change my mind when I learn about java script and so on.
